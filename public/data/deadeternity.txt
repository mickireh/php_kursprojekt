You큞l never be alone again
You큞l never die again
You큞l never be born again
You큞l forever be, stuck here in eternity
I bid you welcome to my world
They call me existence
You have just entered through the gate
To your journey towards eternity
This part I control
In the beginning you큞l fear nothing
As I climb beside you
Time will be your master
In this laborious part of human subsistence
This part I control
Black clouds embraces your soul
Slowly passing through repeating lacunas of anguish
When time takes your life
I will transfer you into the bare grip of thinking tranquility
Voices filling the emptiness of the dead floating
Seamless across the surface into chilling stillness
Nothing can help you now
