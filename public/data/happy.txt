In this hole, that is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole, thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders
I feel into me, so overwhelmed
All this pressures sent arising
My life overturned, unfair the despair
All these scars keep ripping open
Peel me, from the skin
Tear me, from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear me, from the bone
Tear me, from myself
Are you feeling happy now?
In this hole, that is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole, so limiting
The sun that's settle darkens
Buried underneath, hands slip off the wheel
Internal pathways to contention
Peel me, from the skin
Tear me, from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear me, from the bone
Tear me, from myself
Are you feeling happy now?
Happy?
Happy?
Are you feeling happy?
In this hole, that is me
Left with a heart exhausted
What's my release what sets me free
Do you pull me up just to push me down again
Peel me, from the skin
Tear me, from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear me, from the bone
Tear me, from myself
Are you feeling happy now?
Peel me, from the skin
Tear me, from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear me, from the bone
Tear me, from myself
Are you feeling happy now?
Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy now that I'm lost left with nothing
Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy now that I'm lost left with nothing
