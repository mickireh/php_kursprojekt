You were my fire, so I burned
Til' there was nothing left of me
I, I touched your face, I held you close
Til' I could barely breathe
Why give me hope, then give me up
Just to be the death of me
Save the rest of me
'Cause I see you, but I can't feel you anymore - so go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore, you hesitate
Now, now and then, you come around, like there's something left for me
We were one, we were everything
I'm still here, but I'll just keep the rest of me
Cuz I see you, but I can't feel you anymore, so go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore, you hesitate
We never made it, you hesitated, I don't believe
That I see you, but I can't feel you anymore - so go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore, you hesitate
Cuz I see you, but I can't feel you anymore, so go away
I need you, but I can't need you anymore, you hesitate, hesitate
You were my fire, so I burned, now there's nothing left of me
