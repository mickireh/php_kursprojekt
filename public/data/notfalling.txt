Always, known in, all my time,
A little left of center now
Reflect as I realize,
That all I need is to find the middle pillar path to sit like the sun by a
Star in the sky and just be.
Sinners, casting stones at me
I, I stand, not crawling, not falling down
I, I bleed the demons that drag me down
I, I stand, (for nothing), not crawling, (the center), not falling down
(of calms within the eye)
I, I'll bleed, (for no one), the demons, (but myself), that pull me down
(for me and no one else)
Goodbye, sunshine, I've put it out again, sad
I'm over, personalities, conflicting,
I don't need you, or anyone, but me,
I'll just be, living my own life,
I feel my glowing center grow, infecting I feel alive,
Shovel dirt over lime,
Plant it in myself to sit like a seed under covers of earth and just be
Sinners, pointing fingers at me
I, I stand, (for nothing), not crawling, (by myself) not falling down
I, I bleed, (for no one), the demons, (but myself) that drag me down
I, I stand, (for nothing), not crawling, (the center) not falling down
(of calms within the eye)
I, I'll bleed, (for no one), the demons, (but myself) that pull me down
(for me and no one else)
Come play kill.
Refuse my body, refuse my shadow
Stone cold will
Refuse to lead this, refuse to follow
Bitter pills
Refuse to feed this, refuse to swallow, I'm fueled godless
Come play, come play
Kill
Just be, just be
I, I stand (for nothing) not crawling (by myself) not falling down
I, I bleed (for no one) the demons (but myself) that drag me down
I, I stand (for nothing) not crawling (the center) not falling down
(of calms within the eye)
I, I'll bleed (for no one) the demons (but myself) that drag me down
(for me and no one else)
