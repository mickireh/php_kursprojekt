Tried of dull ages, I walk the same ground,
Collecting the tragedies still
Hollow ambitions in a hollow mind
Carried my cross to the hill
And how I lust for the dance and the fire
Deep of the nectarine sunset to drink
Spill me the wind and its fire
To steal of the colors - I´m the moon shield
Shattered hope became my guide
And grief and pain my friends
A brother pact in blood-ink penned
Declared my silent end
Naked and dying under worlds of silent stone
Reaching for the moon shield that once upon us shone
