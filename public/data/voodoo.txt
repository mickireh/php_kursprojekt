I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did I want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came
Candles raise my desire
Why I'm so far away
No more meaning to my life
No more reason to stay
Freezing feeling, breathe in, breathe in
I'm coming back again
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came
Hazing clouds rain on my head
Empty thoughts fill my ears
Find my shade by the moon light
Why my thought aren't so clear
Demons dreaming, breathe in, breathe in
I'm coming back again
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did want to be here again
And I don't remember why I came
Voodo, voodo, voodo, voodo
Voodo, voodo, voodo, voodo
So far away
I'm not the one who's so far away
I'm not the one who's so far away
I'm not the one who's so far away
